////////////// QCADesigner TODO /////////////////

[ ] One selection renderer per layer => compositing

[ ] two apps: 
    - design creation: main_window
    - design testing: graph dialog + bus layout + vector table + sim engine
      - Simulation data /is/ vector table
      - What about number of samples ? Assemble simulation data the way the 
        engine would. IOW, copy the assembly code out of the top of the main
        simulation routine
      - What to display when output no longer reflects inputs ? "Out of date"
        in top left corner of trace
      - Disable engaging simulation when simulation data is loaded from file
      - Editable input honeycombs <=> vector table
      - Button to fill with exhaustive
      - Button to switch back to the sim data for current design
      - Custom (or pixbuf) cell renderer for waveforms and honeycombs

[ ] Add ability for user to change the colors

[ ] Draw mesurements onto the screen and have them remain as a selectable 
    object

[ ] Density/Area Stats

[ ] Graph dialog time reference

[ ] Fork off a process to wait for the previewer and then delete the temp file, 
    in case the previewer survives us

[ ] Print dialog: list of strings representing font names to be used

[ ] graph dialog: All honeycombs for a given bus trace should show as many
    digits as the largest honeycomb value (001,010,100,etc.)

[X] Switched to Gaim's build system (makefile.mingw), but maintained install
    system (Inno Setup). i18n now works in Windoze. Set LANG= in environment
    variables, unless your whole Windoze is in a different language.

[X] Re-wrote QCADDesignObject "properties" and "default_properties" using 
    QCADPropertyUI. UI for setting booleans, enums, doubles, ints, and strings
    is now created automatically.

    [ ] Property UI tabs ("group" UI hint).

[X] Created QCADObject for "default object" as well as property UI hints.

[ ] Molecular QCA simulation engine (three state coherence vector).

[ ] Handle halos properly.

[ ] Selection (design_selection_create_object_array) kept in QCADUndoEntry objects
    should be objects. As long as the contents of the selection doesn't change,
    don't keep on making new object arrays. Keep ref-ing the same array - saves
    memory.

[ ] GUI parameter analysis tool

    [ ] Separate simulation engines

        [ ] Via IPC: QCADesigner spawns batch_sim and communicates with it
        XOR
        [ ] Via .so: build QCADesigner simulation engines into .so - difficult
            because of #ifdef GTK_GUI - will need to formalize report on progress

2.0.3
================================================================================
[X] Switched Windows version from antiquated dropline.net GTK+ distribution to
    Gaim's own GTK+-2.6. This way we can start excising some of the old widgets.

[X] Internationalization now works in Windows. To use the alternative languages,
    set the environment variable LANG to one of de_DE,hu_HU,ro_RO, or fr_FR in
    the "System" control panel's "Advanced" tab.

[X] Converted the layer mapping dialog to a GtkTreeView, including a cell 
    renderer that presents a popup menu of available destination layers (in lieu
    of a GtkCellRendererComboBox). 

[X] Updated manual to reflect new layer mapping dialog behaviour

[X] Cleaned up the gtk_preamble somewhat.

2.0.2
================================================================================
[x] Brand new, more stable, better, cleaner, sharper, neater, greener vector
    table options dialog using GtkTreeView.

    [X] Ability to input dec and hex into the vector table

[X] Convert input to fixed cell, and it continues to show up in vector table.
    Reload file and it dies when trying vector table simulation.

[X] Turn output cell into normal cell, and label persists even across reload.

2.0.1
================================================================================
[X] Does -P have to be present after co in CVS commands ? No.

[X] Line up exhaustive vs. exhaustive vector table simulation results

[X] Open 4_bit_adder, delete everything past and including the adders, simulate:
    segfault.

[X] Selection anchor (when copying?) is chosen "arbitrarily".

[X] Fix sim results printout such that honeycomb and waveform trace headers have
    identical widths.

[X] Draw only visible honeycombs

[X] Separate simulation results viewer tool

[X] Sub-nanometer cell sizes (via more digits and non-snap-to-tics in spin 
    button)

[X] Ctrl+Shift+S == Save As

[X] Set file selection dialog to a more sensible default:
    show_graph_dialog (char *pszSimOutputFName) ;
    sets the file selection to the file name
    create the file selection is now public

[X] Ability to horizontally stretch traces
    - Status bar indicates sample index when mouse moves over traces
    - Hilighting an interval between to samples on a trace will stretch that 
      interval to fit the window
    - Right-clicking before releasing the left mouse button while hilighting a 
      sample range cancels impending stretch

[X] Consistent look for all tools:
    Move the pixmap registration code out of main.c so other gtk targets can 
    benefit from it.

[X] Both honeycomb and waveform drawing areas get created the same way - factor 
    out the code

2.0.0
================================================================================
[X] Cell Library

[X] Hot Key for activating/deactivating all layers other then the one presently
    in use.

[X] Check all menu items most do not work yet. Remove any unused menu items

[W] Difficult to select anything for moving when zoomed out far (workaround: 
    Cancel selection via right-click)

[X] Rotated cells are not printed as such

[X] Must drop selection in layer before deactivating that layer else the 
    selected objects will not be drawn.

[X] Confirmation check on layer delete, unless undo is available

Incompleted Man Pages
[X] Create/Import Block Man page

[X] Vector Table Man page

[X] Correct the bistable man page to include the nonlinear functions
