QCADesigner ToDo's
[X] show_graph_dialog (char *pszSimOutputFName) ;
    sets the file selection to the file name
    create the file selection is now public
[ ] Both honeycomb and waveform drawing areas get created the same way - factor out the code
[ ] Move the pixmap registration code out of main.c so other gtk targets can benefit from it.
[ ] Graph dialog time reference
[ ] Ability to input dec and hex into the vector table
[ ] Fork off a process to wait for the previewer and then delete the temp file, in case the previewer
    survives us

2.0.0
=============================================================================================================
[X] Cell Library
[X] Hot Key for activating/deactivating all layers other then the one presently in use.z
[X] Check all menu items most do not work yet. Remove any unused menu items
[W] Difficult to select anything for moving when zoomed out far
[X] Rotated cells are not printed as such
[X] Must drop selection in layer before deactivating that layer else the selected objects will not be drawn.
[X] Confirmation check on layer delete, unless undo is available

Incompleted Man Pages
[X] Create/Import Block Man page
[X] Vector Table Man page
[X] Correct the bistable man page to include the nonlinear functions

/-------------HIGH PRIORITY-------------/

- Fix mirror problem when mirroring multiple cell types.
- Add ability to draw arbitary shapes and labels to the cad window.
- Add the design document to the new cvs tree.
- UNDO! REDO!
- Add keyboard commands as things move forward.
X Save file box on exit (as this been done?).

FIXES



NEW FEATURES

/-------------MEDIUM PRIORITY-----------/

- signal properties to adjust the clock properties (amplitude, etc).
- when "show grid" is changed the grid does not change until the user clicks the cad window
- up and down keys should not change widgets.
- Ability to change the order of the inputs in the exhaustive simulation.
- User should be able to change the number of samples in a simulation.
- Print the simulation percentage completed into the status bar at bottom of window.
- fix random fault code.
- zoom in out arent really correct. FIX IT
- extents is really not correct especially for large designs
- Do something about the flashing in the cad window (some functions still flash)

- Draw mesurements onto the screen and have them remain as a selectable object.
- Density/Area Stats
- statically link in all the GTK+ libraries.- User defined colors
- Rotate groups of cells
- Flip
- Group rotate (from 90 deg to 45 deg cells)


/-------------LOW PRIORITY--------------/

- Add ability for user to change the colors.
- help about window does not show up
- Add a radio button on the splash screen to not show in anymore.
- add an activate/deactivate cell feature could reduce simulation time if sections are deactivated.
- Support floorplanning

KNOWN BUGS

- if the clock_select_dialog, sim_engine_setup_window, sim_type_setup_window is destroyed with the x and opened again there is some error about the radio button group
- if you run a simulation, then run it again without closing the first window, then close the second window, there is a segmentation fault.
- appears to be one when drawing an array (still determining it's existance)
- inconsistent tool useage (esp. for those with buttons)
- arrow keys stopped working for panning (trying to recreate)
- Mirror copies 45 deg cells to 90 deg. cells
- Middle button zoom doesn't always show everything desired
- Panning with keyboard redraws the pic 4 times
