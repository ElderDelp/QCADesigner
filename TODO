////////////// QCADesigner TODO /////////////////

[ ] Add ability for user to change the colors
[ ] Draw mesurements onto the screen and have them remain as a selectable 
    object
[ ] Density/Area Stats
[ ] Graph dialog time reference
[ ] Ability to input dec and hex into the vector table
[ ] Fork off a process to wait for the previewer and then delete the temp file, 
    in case the previewer survives us
[ ] Print dialog: list of strings representing font names to be used
[ ] graph dialog: All honeycombs for a given bus trace should show as many
    digits as the largest honeycomb value
[ ] Convert input to fixed cell, and it continues to show up in vector table.
    Reload file and it dies when trying vector table simulation.
[ ] Turn output cell into normal cell, and label persists even across reload.

2.0.1
================================================================================
[X] Does -P have to be present after co in CVS commands ? No.
[X] Line up exhaustive vs. exhaustive vector table simulation results
[X] Open 4_bit_adder, delete everything past and including the adders, simulate:
    segfault.
[X] Selection anchor (when copying?) is chosen "arbitrarily".
[X] Fix sim results printout such that honeycomb and waveform trace headers have
    identical widths.
[X] Draw only visible honeycombs
[X] Separate simulation results viewer tool
[X] Sub-nanometer cell sizes (via more digits and non-snap-to-tics in spin 
    button)
[X] Ctrl+Shift+S == Save As
[X] Set file selection dialog to a more sensible default:
    show_graph_dialog (char *pszSimOutputFName) ;
    sets the file selection to the file name
    create the file selection is now public
[X] Ability to horizontally stretch traces
    - Status bar indicates sample index when mouse moves over traces
    - Hilighting an interval between to samples on a trace will stretch that 
      interval to fit the window
    - Right-clicking before releasing the left mouse button while hilighting a 
      sample range cancels impending stretch
[X] Consistent look for all tools:
    Move the pixmap registration code out of main.c so other gtk targets can 
    benefit from it.
[X] Both honeycomb and waveform drawing areas get created the same way - factor 
    out the code

2.0.0
================================================================================
[X] Cell Library
[X] Hot Key for activating/deactivating all layers other then the one presently
    in use.z
[X] Check all menu items most do not work yet. Remove any unused menu items
[W] Difficult to select anything for moving when zoomed out far (workaround: 
    Cancel selection via right-click)
[X] Rotated cells are not printed as such
[X] Must drop selection in layer before deactivating that layer else the 
    selected objects will not be drawn.
[X] Confirmation check on layer delete, unless undo is available

Incompleted Man Pages
[X] Create/Import Block Man page
[X] Vector Table Man page
[X] Correct the bistable man page to include the nonlinear functions
