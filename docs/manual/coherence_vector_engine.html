<h2>Coherence Vector Simulation Engine</h2>
<p>The coherence vector simulation is based on a density matrix approach and can model dissipative effects as well as time dependant simulation of the design. As with the other simulation engines assumes that each cell is a simple two-state system. For this two-state system, it has been shown that the following Hamiltonian can be constructed<a href="#1">[1]</a>.

<p><center><img src="images/two_state_hamiltonian.png"></center>

<p>where <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> is the kink energy between cell <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. This kink energy is associated with the energy cost of two cells having opposite polarization. <i>P<sub>j</sub></i> is the polarization of cell <i>j</i>. <i>&gamma;</i> is the tunneling energy of electrons within the cell. The summation is over all cells within an <a href="#radius_of_effect">effective radius</a> of cell <i>i</i>, and can be set prior to the simulation. Using the time-independent Schroedinger equation we are able to find the stationary states of the cell in the environment described by this Hamiltonian. QCADesigner uses the Jacobi algorithm to find the eigenvalues (<i>E<sub>i</sub></i>) and eigenvectors (<i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i>) of the Hamiltonian

<p><center><img src="images/shroedinger_equation.png"></center>

<p>where <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> is the Hamiltonian given above. <i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i> is the state vector of the cell. <i>E<sub>i</sub></i> is the energy associated with the state. The algorithm sorts each of the states, <i>&psi;<sub>i</sub></i> , according to their respective energy, in ascending order. The first state in the sorted list is that which has the lowest energy. Our assumption is that the system remains very close to the ground state during computation. As a result, the state with the lowest energy is chosen and the cell polarization is set accordingly. The two state simulation engine computes the polarization of each cell in the design until the entire system has converged to a <a href="#convergence_tolerance">preset tolerance</a>. Once the system has converged, the output values are recorded, new input values are set and the simulation is reiterated.

<p>This method is less time efficient in comparison to the <a href="nonlinear_approximation_engine.html">nonlinear approximation</a>, and as a result leads to longer simulation times. The advantage of this method is that the model on which it is based is more accurate.

<h2>Kink Energy</h2>
<p>The kink energy <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> represents the energy cost of cells <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> having opposite polarization. It is calculated simply from the electrostatic interaction between all the charges (mobile/immobile). That is, for each dot in cell <i>i</i> we calculate the electrostatic interaction between this dot and each dot in cell <i>j</i> as

<p><center><img src="images/electrostatic_energy.png"></center>

<p>here &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is the permittivity of free space and &epsilon;<sub>r</sub> is the <a href="#relative_permittivity">relative permittivity</a> of the material system. This is summed over all <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. To find the kink energy we first compute this electrostatic energy when the cells have opposite polarization, then again when the cells have the same polarization and subtract them.

<p>Because the cell is charge neutral (immobile positive charges cancel the charged electrons) the cells interact through a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction which decays inversely as a power of five of the distance between cells. Therefore the kink energy will decay rapidly with distance and the <a href="#radius_of_effect">effective neighborhood</a> of interacting cells can be made small.

<h2>Engine Options</h2>

<center><img src="images/coherence_options.png" alt="Bistable Simulation Options"></center>

<a name="temperature">
<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>The temperature of the simulation in Kelvins. Has an effect on the steady state vector as described above.

<a name="relaxation_time">
<h3>Relaxation Time</h3>

<p>The relaxation time &tau; is explained above and determines how quickly the system settles to a steady state.

<a name="time_step">
<h3>Time Step</h3>

<p>The time step between samples. Because this engine is currently using an explicit time marching algorithm the simulation may become unstable if this value is too large. If the simulation becomes unstable the engine will immediately quit and you will have to reduce the time step. If you set it too small relative to the <a href="#total_simulation_time">total simulation time</a> the simulation may take an unreasonable amount of time.

<a name="total_simulation_time">
<h3>Total Simulation Time</h3>

<p>The total duration of the simulation. Be carefull not to set this to large if your <a href="time_step">time step</a> is too small because the simulation may take days! The total number of samples = total simulation time / time step.

<a name="clock_low">
<a name="clock_high">
<h3>Clock High/Clock Low</h3>

<p>Clock low and high values are tied directly to the tunneling energy in the Hamiltonian. When the clock is high the cell is unlatched. When it is low the cell is latched. The defaults seem to work in most cases, however, you may wish to play with them.

<a name="relative_permittivity">
<h3>Relative Permittivity</h3>

<p>The relative permittivity of the material system you want to simulate. For GaAs/AlGaAs it is roughly 12.9 which is the default value. This is only used in calculating the kink energy. 

<a name="radius_of_effect">
<h3>Radius of Effect</h3>

<p>Because the interaction effect of one cell onto another decays inversely with the fifth power of the distance between cells, we do not need to consider each cell to affect every other cell. This number determines how far each cell will look to find its neighbors. Make sure that at least the next-to-nearest neighbors are included in this radius. If you only allow for the nearest neighbor then I would not expect designs with coplanar crossovers to work. The following figure should help clear this up.
