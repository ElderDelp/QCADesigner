<h2>Nonlinear Approximation Engine</h2>

<p>The nonlinear approximation simulation engine is built on a nonlinear approximation to the cell-to-cell response function. It has been shown that two cells have a nonlinear cell-to-cell response function as illustrated below<a href="#1">[1]</a>.
 
<p><center><img src="images/cellcellresponse.png"></center>

<p>This approximation excludes the quantum mechanical correlations between cells. The system is assumed to switch adiabatically, always remaining very close to the ground state. The polarization state of each of the cells is computed using

<p><center><img src="images/nonlinear_approx_formula.png"></center>

<p>where <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> is the polarization state of the cell, and <i>P<sub>j</sub></i> is the polarization state of the neighboring cells. <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> is the <a href="#kink_energy">kink energy</a> between cells <i>i</i>, and <i>j</i> and represents the energy cost of oppositely polarized cells. &gamma; is the tunneling potential and is used to clock the circuit, as described in <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Since experimentally determined switching times are not available, the simulation does not include any timing information. Using this response function the simulation engine calculates the state of each cell with respect to other cells within a preset effective radius. This calculation is iterated until the entire system converges within a predetermined tolerance. Once the circuit has converged, the output is recorded and new input values are set.It is believed that although this approximation is sufficient to verify the logical functionality of a design it cannot be extended to include valid dynamic simulation; but, as a result of its simplicity this simulation engine is able to simulate a large number of cells very rapidly, and therefore provides a good in-process check of the design. For a more accurate simulation the <a href="bistable_simulation_engine.html">bistable simulation</a> engine is required. For dynamical simulations refer to the <a href="coherence_vector_engine.html">coherence vector simulation</a>.

<a name="kink_energy">
<h2>Kink Energy</h2>
<p>The kink energy <i>E<sup>k</sup><sub>i,j</sub></i> represents the energy cost of cells <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> having opposite polarization. It is calculated simply from the electrostatic interaction between all the charges (mobile/immobile). That is, for each dot in cell <i>i</i> we calculate the electrostatic interaction between this dot and each dot in cell <i>j</i> as

<p><center><img src="images/electrostatic_energy.png"></center>

<p>here &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is the permittivity of free space and &epsilon;<sub>r</sub> is the <a href="#relative_permittivity">relative permittivity</a> of the material system. This is summed over all <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. To find the kink energy we first compute this electrostatic energy when the cells have opposite polarization, then again when the cells have the same polarization and subtract them.

<p>Because the cell is charge neutral (immobile positive charges cancel the charged electrons) the cells interact through a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction which decays inversely as a power of five of the distance between cells. Therefore the kink energy will decay rapidly with distance and the effective neighborhood of interacting cells can be made small.

<h2>Engine Options</h2>

<a name="number_of_samples">
<h3>Number of Samples</h3>

<p>The total simulation is divided by the number of samples. For each sample, the simulation engine looks at each cell and calculates its polarization based on the polarization of its effective neighbors (determined by the radius of effect). The larger this number the longer the simulation will take to complete. However, if you choose too small a number you may not get the expected results, because there will not be sufficient samples during input transitions. If you suspect that your results should be something other than what they are, I recommend that you try to increase this number.

<a name="relative_permittivity">
<h3>Relative Permittivity</h3>

<p>The relative permittivity of the material system you want to simulate. For GaAs/AlGaAs it is roughly 12.9 which is the default value. This is only used in calculating the kink energy. 

<a name="clock_low">
<a name="clock_high">
<h3>Clock High/Clock Low</h3>

<p>Clock low and high values are tied directly to the tunneling energy in the Hamiltonian. When the clock is high the cell is unlatched. When it is low the cell is latched. The defaults seem to work in most cases, however, you may wish to play with them.
