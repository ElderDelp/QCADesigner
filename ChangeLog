	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add m4.
	(SUBDIRS): Remove intl.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath mkinstalldirs.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add m4/Makefile.

Version 1.20

New Features

- Added bistable simulation engine which uses the Jacobi algorithm to calculte eigenvalues/vectors of Hamiltonian.
- Added ability to run a real-time animated simulation.
- Added ability to calculate and show ground state of the cells (ignores clocks).
- Cells now show and retain their polarization.
- Array tool now draws the cells instead of just a line where the cells would be.
- Now able to save/load vector tables to/from file.
- Mouse wheel now works. (up/down with no modifier, left/right with ctrl)
- Mouse pan works with left mouse button and ctrl modifier.
- Tool bar buttons are now toggle buttons and stay on while tool is in use.
- Added print capabilities which allows to print ps to file or send to printer(Great work by Gabriel Schulhof).
- Added recent files menu item.
- Implemented the rulers which were there before but did not function.

Bug Fixes

- Higher contrast colours for the various clocks.
  Only the colour for clock 2 needed changing (now cyan).
- Fixed focus bug where panning with the arrow keys would change the focus.
- Cleaned up all the dialogs.
- Eliminated some of the screen flashing with many of the tools.

Changes

- Changed some of the simulation options default values.

Version 1.10

New Features
- Added ability to place 2 different cell types with configurable paprameters(ie, cell width, height, dot diameter).
- Added ability to test circuit from a vector table.
- Re-coded the file structure, now in ASCII text format and will work between platforms.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the problem with the wacky grid points when zooming to far.
- Slight speed improvment with the drawing (ie. less flashing).
- Fixed problem when drawing arrays with grid spacing smaller then the width of the cell, cells do not overlap anymore.
- Fixed problem with closing dialogs using the "x".
- Some others that I forget now.
