ChangeLog for next release -- 1.4.

Completed Changes/Bug Fixes/Additions:
-- Made fonts work in Win32 (avoiding font-related segfaults)
-- Made print preview work in Win32.  I had to figure out how to
   build the command line so system() would work.  The solution:
   GetShortPathName.  IOW, get the ugly, DOSsy path from the nice,
   Windozey path.
-- Modified file operations UI.
-- Removed message_box.[ch].  Though less convenient,
   gtk_dialog_message_new should be used instead of message_box.
-- Implemented state pattern for mouse actions
-- Consolidated cell functions (Normal/Input/Output/Fixed) into one dialog.
-- Implemented complex(er) selections (Ctrl+Select == remove from selection,
   Shift+Select == add to selection)
-- Trimmed configure.in and Makefile.in to reduce warnings.
-- Started work on implementing layers.
-- Added the ability to print out simulation results.
-- New simulation engine: Coherence Vector
-- Faster graph drawing algorithm
-- Initial multilingual support (suggestions/corrections to schulhof@atips.ca)

Desired Changes:
-- The ability to add arbitrary numbers of layers, each of which may or may not
   have a physical significance (at the discretion of the simulation engine)
