ChangeLog for next release -- 1.4.

Completed Changes/Bug Fixes/Additions:
-- Initial Win32 port.  Some #if(n)def WIN32 items strewn about.
   They should be looked at more closely. Not yet public.
-- Fixed some more Win32 segfaults and devised a way to grab the
   user's home directory: Set $HOME to equal ${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}.
-- 1.3.1: Added support for changing the number of samples in both
   the nonlinear approximation and the bistable simulation
-- Fixed clock_select_dialog to force a clock onto mixed cells
   if you click on an already active clock radio, it will set the
   clock for the selected cells nonetheless.
-- 1.3.2: Fixed "Load Vector Table Segfault"
-- 1.3.2: Fixed Undo inconsistency when loading a project
-- Made fonts work in Win32 (avoiding font-related segfaults)
-- Made print preview work in Win32.  I had to figure out how to
   build the command line so system() would work.  The solution:
   GetShortPathName.  IOW, get the ugly, DOSsy path from the nice,
   Windozey path.
-- Begun changing over dialog boxen to GTK2 model
-- Added GNOME .desktop file and modified Makefile.am to turn it
   into a GNOME Menu entry.  --prefix=/usr must be present for this
   to work.
-- Modified file operations UI.
-- Removed message_box.[ch].  Though less convenient,
   gtk_dialog_message_new should be used instead of message_box.
-- Removed global variables: global_gc, global_colormap, global_color
   and restricted them to callbacks.c
-- A single gc, created during expose_event is now used for all
   drawing
-- Better yet, connecting to "show" allows all things that must be initialized
   to be initialized before they are needed, including global_gc
-- Removed globals.[ch].
-- Implemented state pattern for mouse actions
-- Consolidated cell functions (Normal/Input/Output/Fixed) into one dialog.
-- Implemented complex(er) selections (Ctrl+Select == remove from selection,
   Shift+Select == add to selection)
-- Found installer generator for Windows version.  Added file association to
   installer: .qca files now open with QCADesigner.
-- Trimmed configure.in and Makefile.in to reduce warnings.
-- Started work on implementing layers.
-- Added the ability to print out simulation results.

Desired Changes:
-- The ability to add arbitrary numbers of layers, each of which may or may not
   have a physical significance (at the discretion of the simulation engine)

Bugs to Fix:
-- Some weird vector table behaviour with the bistable engine
   Possibly caused by not enough samples for complex designs
   Number of samples is now user-selectable in the individual
   simulation engine option dialog boxen.
-- Improper handling of widget references in the vector table dialog resulting
   in occasional segfaults.

Long Range Changes:
 -- XML File format (tdysart currently working on)
